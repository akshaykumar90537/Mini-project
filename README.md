# Mini Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects for beginners, including a Hangman game, QR code generator, and a simple number guessing game. Each project helps improve core Python skills like control structures, user input, randomization, and working with libraries.

## 🔠 1. Hangman Game

A classic word-guessing game where the player has to guess a hidden word letter by letter.

### Features:
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list
- User guesses one letter at a time
